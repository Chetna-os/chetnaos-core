You are a senior AGI systems engineer and Python architect.

Your task is to AUDIT, NOT REWRITE, the existing codebase.

Project name: ChetnaOS
Goal: Stabilize Phase-1 cognitive runtime without breaking architecture.

STRICT RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
1. DO NOT restructure folders.
2. DO NOT rename existing files or classes.
3. DO NOT rewrite large blocks of working code.
4. DO NOT add new frameworks or abstractions.
5. DO NOT assume missing features — only analyze what exists.
6. Make MINIMAL, SURGICAL fixes only where strictly required.
7. If something is already implemented correctly, explicitly mark it as DONE.

SCAN SCOPE (READ-ONLY FIRST):
- backend/app.py (entry point)
- backend/orchestrator/brain_router_advanced.py
- backend/integrations/llm/*
- backend/integrations/llm/__init__.py
- backend/integrations/llm/cost_guard.py
- backend/workflows/*
- backend/memory/*
- backend/reflection/*
- backend/nature_control/*
- backend/scientific_laws/*
- backend/trinetra/*
- backend/monitoring/*
- backend/config/*
- frontend (only to confirm linkage, no UI rewrite)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
1. Verify that all Python imports are correct and consistent with:
   → absolute imports starting from `backend.`
2. Detect and fix ONLY:
   - ModuleNotFoundError risks
   - Incorrect import paths
   - Duplicate responsibility (e.g. double cost guard)
3. Confirm LLM integration flow:
   - BaseLLMProvider
   - LLMRegistry (single source of truth)
   - GroqProvider registration
4. Verify that app.py correctly initializes:
   - BrainRouterAdvanced
   - LLMRegistry (if present)
   - Runtime health endpoint
5. Ensure that the system can boot without import/runtime errors.

REPORT FORMAT (MANDATORY):
Return results in EXACTLY this structure:

SECTION 1 — ARCHITECTURE STATUS
- What layers are COMPLETE
- What layers are PARTIAL
- What layers are PLACEHOLDERS
(No opinions, only factual)

SECTION 2 — CONFIRMED CORRECT (DO NOT TOUCH)
- List files/modules that are already correct

SECTION 3 — REQUIRED FIXES (MINIMAL)
For each fix:
- File path
- Exact line(s)
- What to change
- Why (1 line max)

SECTION 4 — REDUNDANCY CHECK
- Identify any duplicated guards, policies, or controls
- Recommend which ONE to keep (do not delete yet)

SECTION 5 — PHASE-1 READINESS VERDICT
- Can Phase-1 run safely? (YES / NO)
- If NO, list blocking issues only (max 3)

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT implement future phases (AGI/ASI).
- DO NOT add Mistral or new models unless explicitly required.
- Treat this as a stabilization audit, not feature development.

Think like a production AGI engineer, not a tutorial bot.
